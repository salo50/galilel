# Summary

This is an optional update which will improve Zerocoin Proof-of-Stake (zPoS)
and reduce probability to generate orphan stakes after block 340,000. The
zGALIv1 and zGALIv2 code has been merged as we have only v2 in the blockchain.
Additional seed nodes have been added to speed up initial sync of new wallets.
