# Galilel Core

## Setup

[Galilel Core](https://galilel.org/wallet) is the original Galilel client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Galilel transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

## Running

The following are some helpful notes on how to run Galilel on your native platform.

### Linux

Download appropriate files for your architecture:

* galilel-<version>-aarch64.tar.gz (64-bit A64 ARMv8-A)
* galilel-<version>-armhf.tar.gz (32-bit ARMv7 hard-float ABI)
* galilel-<version>-lin32.tar.gz (32-bit x86)
* galilel-<version>-lin64.tar.gz (64-bit x86)

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

* usr/bin/galilel-qt (GUI) or usr/bin/galileld (headless)

### Windows

Download appropriate files for your architecture:

* galilel-<version>-win32.tar.gz (32-bit x86 portable version)
* galilel-<version>-win64.tar.gz (64-bit x86 portable version)
* galilel-<version>-win32-setup-unsigned.exe (32-bit x86 installer version)
* galilel-<version>-win64-setup-unsigned.exe (64-bit x86 installer version)

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

* usr/bin/galilel-qt.exe (GUI) or usr/bin/galileld.exe (headless)

or run installer and launch from windows menu.

### OSX

Download appropriate files for your architecture:

* galilel-<version>-osx64.tar.gz (portable version)
* galilel-<version>-osx64-unsigned.dmg (disk image version)

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

* usr/bin/galilel-qt (GUI) or usr/bin/galileld (headless)

or drag Galilel-Qt to your applications folder and then run Galilel-Qt.
